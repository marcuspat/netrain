Hey Product Hunt! 👋

Creator of NetRain here. After watching The Matrix for the nth time, I wondered: "What if we could visualize network traffic this way?"

6 months later, here we are with:
- 1.2ns packet parsing (that's nanoseconds!)
- Japanese Katakana for authentic Matrix feel
- Real security features (not just eye candy)
- Particle effects because why not? 

Try the demo: `sudo netrain --demo`

### Comment

Hi HN! I've built NetRain, a network packet monitor that visualizes traffic as Matrix-style digital rain.

Technical details:
- Zero-allocation packet parsing achieving 1.2ns per packet
- Real-time threat detection in 29ns
- 60 FPS rendering with < 50MB memory usage
- Cross-platform using libpcap/Npcap

The interesting part was optimizing for both performance and visual appeal. Used lookup tables for character sets, object pooling for render objects, and careful memory management to achieve these speeds.

It's not just eye candy - it includes DDoS detection, port scan identification, and protocol anomaly detection with instant visual alerts.

Built in Rust using tokio, ratatui, and pcap crates.

Demo: cargo install netrain && sudo netrain --demo
Code: [GitHub link]

Happy to discuss the technical challenges, especially around zero-allocation architectures and terminal rendering optimization!

# The Matrix Has Your Packets 🌧️

Ever watched The Matrix and thought, "I wish my network monitoring looked that cool"? Well, I did, and that's how NetRain was born.

![NetRain Demo](demo.gif)

## The Challenge

Creating a network monitor that's both:
1. **Blazing fast** - processing thousands of packets per second
2. **Visually stunning** - smooth 60 FPS Matrix rain effect
3. **Actually useful** - real-time threat detection

Spoiler: We achieved 212x faster packet parsing and it looks incredible.
