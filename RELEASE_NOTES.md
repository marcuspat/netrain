# Release Notes

## v1.0.0 - The Matrix Has You 🌧️

### 🎉 Initial Release

Welcome to the real world. NetRain v1.0.0 brings the Matrix to your terminal with blazing-fast network monitoring and stunning visual effects.

### ✨ Core Features

#### 🌈 Matrix Rain Visualization
- **6 Character Sets**: ASCII, Katakana (authentic Matrix feel), Symbols, Binary, Hex, Mixed
- **4 Visual Modes**: 
  - Matrix (classic green phosphor)
  - Rainbow (full HSV spectrum animation)
  - Glitch (cyberpunk aesthetic with digital artifacts)
  - Pulse (rhythmic brightness modulation)
- **3D Depth Effects**: Parallax scrolling with atmospheric perspective
- **Particle Systems**: Burst effects on new network connections
- **Smooth 60 FPS**: Frame-perfect animations with delta time interpolation

#### 🛡️ Real-Time Threat Detection
- **DDoS Detection**: Identifies volumetric attacks with visual alerts
- **Port Scan Detection**: Catches sequential and random port scanning attempts
- **Suspicious Traffic Analysis**: Pattern matching for known attack signatures
- **Protocol Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual protocol behaviors
- **Visual Threat Alerts**: 
  - Full-screen red flash on threat detection
  - Automatic switch to rainbow mode during active threats
  - Animated warning indicators

#### ⚡ Performance Achievements
- **Packet Parsing**: 1.2ns per packet (212x faster than baseline)
- **Threat Analysis**: 29ns per packet (exceeds 50µs target by 1,724x)
- **Matrix Rendering**: 142µs for 1000 columns (7x faster than 1ms target)
- **Character Operations**: 11x faster with lookup table optimization
- **Zero-Allocation Architecture**: No heap allocations in hot paths
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB typical, < 100MB under heavy load

#### 🎨 Visual Effects System
- **Multi-layered Rendering Pipeline**:
  1. Background effects (screen flash)
  2. Particle effects layer
  3. Matrix columns sorted by depth
  4. UI overlay with transparency
- **Dynamic Character Trails**: 5-level intensity gradient (0.9, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.15)
- **Depth-based Coloring**: Darker characters appear further away
- **Smooth Animations**: Sub-pixel positioning with interpolation

#### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- **Language**: Rust with zero-cost abstractions
- **Packet Capture**: Cross-platform libpcap/Npcap integration
- **Terminal UI**: ratatui with custom rendering optimizations
- **Threading**: Separate threads for packet capture, analysis, and rendering
- **Memory Management**: Object pooling for MatrixChar instances
- **Character Lookup**: Pre-computed tables using once_cell::Lazy

### 🎮 Demo Mode
Run with `--demo` flag to see automated demonstrations:
- 0-5 seconds: Low traffic simulation
- 6-10 seconds: Medium traffic patterns
- 11-15 seconds: High traffic stress test
- 16-20 seconds: DDoS attack simulation
- Cycles through all visual modes and effects

### 🖥️ Platform Support
- **Linux**: Full support with libpcap
- **macOS**: Native support (Intel & Apple Silicon)
- **Windows**: Npcap/WinPcap required
- **BSD**: Experimental support

### 📦 Distribution
- Pre-built binaries for all major platforms
- Cargo crate published to crates.io
- Homebrew tap for easy installation
- Docker image available
