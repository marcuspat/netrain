### üî® Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes: `cargo test`
5. Make sure your code follows the style guidelines: `cargo fmt`
6. Make sure your code passes clippy: `cargo clippy`
7. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

1. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/netrain.git
   cd netrain
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install libpcap

   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev

   # Arch
   sudo pacman -S libpcap
   ```

3. **Build and test**
   ```bash
   cargo build
   cargo test
   cargo run -- --demo
   ```

## Style Guidelines

### Rust Code Style

- Follow standard Rust naming conventions
- Use `cargo fmt` before committing
- Use `cargo clippy` and fix any warnings
- Write doc comments for public APIs
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `mut` when possible
- Use descriptive variable names

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc)
- `refactor:` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` - Performance improvement
- `test:` - Adding missing tests
- `chore:` - Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

Example:
```
feat: add rainbow mode for threat visualization

- Implement HSV color cycling during active threats
- Add configuration option for rainbow speed
- Update visual effects documentation
```

### Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add doc comments to new public functions/modules
- Include examples in doc comments when helpful
- Update CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Write integration tests for cross-module features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Add test data files to `tests/fixtures/` if needed
- Run benchmarks if you're making performance claims

## Performance Considerations

NetRain is performance-critical. When contributing:

- Run benchmarks before and after your changes
- Avoid allocations in hot paths
- Use `cargo flamegraph` to profile if needed
- Document performance implications
- Consider using `#[inline]` for small, frequently-called functions
